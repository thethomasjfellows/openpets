# Plugin Platform

OpenPets plugins are small companion programs that extend the pet: reminders,
focus timers, a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet, GitHub notifications, and so on.
This doc is the platform architecture — the manifest contract, the permission
model, the runtime and sandbox, install paths, and packaging/publishing. For the
*author-facing* API see [sdk.md](sdk.md); for the product direction and the
official lineup see [superplugins.md](superplugins.md).

This doc is required reading before changing plugin platform code, official
plugins, catalog generation, packaging, runtime behavior, or plugin-facing UI
(per `AGENTS.md`). When you change behavior, update this doc in the same change.

Source maps: `apps/desktop/src/codemap.md` (the `plugin-*.ts` modules),
`plugins/codemap.md`, `plugins/official/codemap.md`, `packages/sdk/codemap.md`.

## Source lanes

Plugin source is split by publishing intent:

- `plugins/official/` — first-party, reviewed OpenPets plugins. Only these can be
  bundled or enabled by default.
- `plugins/community/` — public catalog plugins that are reviewed and shipped
  through the same ZIP/SHA/catalog pipeline, but are labeled `publisherType:
  "community"` and cannot be bundled.
- `plugins/dev/` — local experiments only. The catalog generator ignores this
  lane; move a plugin to `community/` or `official/` before publishing.

## Mental model

A plugin is a **package** validated by a **manifest**, run inside a **sandbox**,
talking to the host only through a **permission-checked SDK bridge**. The host
owns every side effect — the plugin only *describes* what it wants (a bubble, an
alert, a scheduled job, a stored value), and the host validates and renders it.
This is the "companion-first" stance: plugins never inject UI into pet windows
directly; they hand the host descriptors and the host owns layout and lifecycle.

`ctx.pet.speak()` produces an ordinary pet speech bubble. If the user enables
the host-level **Read speech bubbles aloud** preference, OpenPets may narrate
that bubble with the user's selected host voice provider; plugins do not need another permission or API
call, and must not depend on narration being enabled. Plain-text transient
`ctx.ui.bubble()` content may also be narrated; pinned, markdown-only, and
interactive bubbles are excluded. Quiet
hours mute automatic bubble narration as well as the existing plugin voice and
sound surfaces.

`ctx.voice.speak(text, { petHandleId })` is the explicit audible path and
requires `voice:speak`. Omitting `petHandleId` targets the default pet; supplying
a handle returned by `ctx.pets.spawn()` targets only that calling plugin's live
pet. The host applies the target pet's voice override and fallbacks. Plugins
never receive provider credentials or generated audio. `ctx.voice.listen()`
remains one-shot, permission-gated, non-ambient, and uses the same host-owned
capture/privacy surface reserved for explicit plugin microphone requests.

`ctx.companion` is intentionally weaker than speech or provider access. A plugin
may contribute short-lived factual context or offer a short-lived proactive
opportunity, but it cannot write the pet's line, select a provider, trigger
speech, persist OpenPets recent memory, or force delivery. The host treats all
contributed text as untrusted quoted data and asks the selected provider for
original companion-style wording only after its own consent and policy checks.

## The manifest — `openpets.plugin.json`

The manifest is the contract the host validates before *any* plugin code runs
(`plugin-manifest.ts`, schema versions v1/v2/v3). Current plugins are
`manifestVersion: 3` / `sdkVersion: 3.x`. Key fields:

- `manifestVersion`, `id` (e.g. `openpets.reminders`), `name`, `description`,
  `version`, `sdkVersion`.
- `runtime`: `javascript` for SDK plugins (declarative timer-only plugins also
  exist for the simplest cases).
- `entry`: the JS entry file (e.g. `index.js`).
- `permissions`: the capabilities the plugin requests (see below).
- `configSchema`: typed config fields rendered as a no-JSON settings form.
  Fields include text, number, boolean, select, time, date, secret, and sound;
  a select can opt into the host's `sprite-grid` presentation when every option
  references a declared sprite preview.
- `assets`: declared icon/image/svg/sprite/sound refs (validated, see below).
- `commands`, `status`, `panels`, `network` hosts, and timer triggers as
  applicable.
- Localization: `name`/`description`/labels can be `$t:` keys resolved from
  `locales/en.json` (see [i18n.md](i18n.md)).

`name`/`description`/labels in the manifest use `$t:` references; the catalog
generator and release validator fail if those don't resolve.

Catalog card icons can use bundled SVG assets. A plugin declares the SVG under
`assets.icons` (for example `"assets": { "icons": { "spotify":
"assets/spotify.svg" } }`); the packaging flow sanitizes the SVG and embeds it
as catalog `iconDataUrl`. Do **not** use external SVG URLs for plugin icons — the
icon must be part of the reviewed, hash-pinned package.

### Manifest reading is hardened

`plugin-manifest-reader.ts` enforces realpath/allowed-root checks, requires the
manifest to be the root file, caps size, and matches the expected id/version.
The manifest is never trusted blindly.

## Permission model

### Sprite-grid configuration

`sprite-grid` is a presentation for a `select` field, not a general renderer
surface. Each option names a manifest-declared sprite as its preview; manifest
validation rejects undeclared previews. The Control Center renders those choices
as accessible radio cards, with animation only for the selected, hovered, or
keyboard-focused card. `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the first frame static.

Calendar Airmail uses this for its courier choice. The couriers are bundled
plugin assets, not installed pets: changing the selection never reads the pet
catalog, changes the default pet, or depends on a user-installed companion.

Permissions are declared in the manifest, **approved** by the user at install,
persisted in plugin state, and **re-checked on every SDK call** by the bridge.
The permission surface (from `plugin-manifest.ts`):

`timer`/`schedule`, `pet:*`, `pets:*`, `audio`, `events`, `ui:*`,
`companion:context`, `notify`, `bus`, `ai`, `secrets`, `voice:*`, `auth`,
`files`, `system:*`, `clipboard`, `network:*`.

A plugin that calls a namespace it didn't declare (or wasn't approved for) is
denied and the block is recorded in diagnostics. `network:*` is further
constrained to declared hosts. This is defense in depth: manifest validation,
user approval, runtime permission check, and quotas all apply.

### Companion context contributions

The `companion:context` permission unlocks three SDK calls:
`ctx.companion.contributeFact`, `offerOpportunity`, and `remove`. Permission
approval is the plugin-specific disclosure boundary: the host accepts
contributions only while Companion and that plugin are enabled. There is no
duplicate global Plugin context or Sensitive plugin context switch. The
permission is classified as sensitive at both manifest validation and UI
approval boundaries because its text may be placed in an AI prompt.
Disabled plugins are ignored and their retained contributions are cleared on
teardown. Calls are rate-limited to 20 per minute.

Facts and opportunities use plugin-scoped keys, plain text capped at 500
characters, and an expiry within 24 hours. The in-memory host store is capped at
32 retained items per plugin and 256 overall. It is deliberately not persisted:
a plugin that needs restart continuity stores its own domain state and
contributes the current fact/opportunity again. Contributions belong to the
active default companion. This first contract deliberately has no pet-handle
override, so plugins cannot retarget context to spawned or agent pets.

This is a host-mediated context channel, not direct access to the selected AI
provider. A plugin cannot call Codex, inherit the user's Codex MCP servers,
install an MCP server into Companion conversations, inspect conversation
history, or receive the Brain's response through this permission. If Codex is
the active Brain, OpenPets quotes approved contributions as untrusted context in
the bounded prompt while Codex still runs with user config, plugins, rules,
shell tooling, and global MCPs disabled. A Screenpipe-style plugin should use
this permission to contribute expiring screen observations; any future callable
plugin tool contract must be a separate explicit permission and API.

An opportunity carries factual `context`, low/normal urgency, an eligibility
window, a dedupe key, and optional cooldown. The host can ignore it for consent,
quiet-hours, interaction, provider-health, daily/spacing, plugin-cap, expiry, or
dedupe reasons. Consumption starts the plugin-scoped cooldown. The bundled
Focus Buddy is the first pilot: during an active, unpaused focus session it
offers one low-urgency mid-session opportunity, then removes it when the session
pauses, ends, or is no longer eligible. Focus Buddy never supplies the final
check-in sentence.

### Display deliveries

`ui:delivery` is a dedicated permission for the generic, host-owned delivery
surface. It lets a plugin request a short, plain-text delivery with one of its
own declared courier sprites; it is not permission to position windows, inject
markup, select arbitrary files, or control animation. The host chooses the cursor
display, renders the courier and banner together, queues competing deliveries,
enforces expiry and quotas, and owns the window lifecycle. The returned handle
can be dismissed and can observe `click`, `manual`, `expired`, or
`plugin-stopped` dismissal. Plugin teardown
removes that plugin's pending and active deliveries without calling handlers in
the stopped host. See [sdk.md](sdk.md) for the author contract.

This surface is intended for time-sensitive companion messages such as Calendar
Airmail, not as a general custom-overlay API.

## Runtime & sandbox

`plugin-runtime.ts` is the engine:

- Compiles **declarative timer triggers** for enabled manifests and schedules
  cancellable timers.
- Starts/stops a **JavaScript host** per JS plugin and verifies approved
  permissions before dispatching actions.
- Exposes public **command/status** state to the UI, validates actions, and
  **marks a plugin broken** on validation/action failure (surfaced in the
  inspector/health UI).

`plugin-js-host.ts` is the sandbox: a hidden `BrowserWindow` with a per-plugin
session partition, navigation/window-open hardening, an SDK IPC **token**, a
registration handshake at startup, config-listener cleanup, and teardown. The
plugin's `index.js` runs here, isolated from the renderer and the main process.

`plugin-sdk-bridge.ts` is the gate between the sandbox and the host. It
validates routes, builds the per-plugin context, enforces permissions + quotas,
and delegates to focused namespace modules (`plugin-sdk-audio`, `-bus`,
`-config`, `-events`, `-quotas`, `-routes`, `-state`, `-storage`, `-ui`, plus
`plugin-voice`, `plugin-oauth`, `plugin-secrets`, `plugin-ai-gateway`,
`plugin-panels`, `plugin-pet-api`/`plugin-pet-registry`). The split keeps each
capability's permission check and host effect localized. The author-facing
mirror of all this is the SDK in [sdk.md](sdk.md).

### Supporting modules

- `plugin-state.ts` — atomic JSON store (`userData/openpets-plugin-state.json`):
  installed plugins, enabled flag, approved permissions, config, source, broken
  reason, update metadata.
- `plugin-config.ts` — default/effective config validation and reference
  resolution.
- `plugin-assets.ts` — validates/resolves declared assets (formats + size caps)
  for SDK refs and catalog cards. Courier sprites are WebP strips with bounded,
  declared frame metadata; their dimensions are checked at package/install time.
- `plugin-bubble-arbiter.ts` — priority/coalescing of transient vs pinned bubble
  slots.
- `plugin-diagnostics.ts` — per-plugin error/quota/settings-block collector for
  the inspector and health UI.
- `companion-contributions.ts` — process-local, consent-checked, expiring facts
  and opportunities plus dedupe/cooldown and total/per-plugin caps.
- `plugin-platform-settings.ts` — global gates for audio, voice, speech,
  microphone, quiet hours, the host-AI compatibility projection, and the
  quiet-hours check reused by host speech and proactive check-ins. Provider
  settings are owned by `host-ai-settings.ts`; configured legacy `ai` data is
  migrated out of `openpets-plugin-platform.json`.
- Plugins currently use the one globally selected AI Brain when an approved
  host capability needs inference. Provider profiles have stable IDs so a
  future plugin-level override can reference one without duplicating provider
  credentials, but plugins do not select or override a profile today.
- `plugin-user-sound-store.ts` — stores imported user sounds as opaque refs, not
  raw filesystem paths.
- `plugin-i18n.ts` — resolves plugin locales, manifest `$t:`, and `ctx.t()`.

## Install paths

### Catalog install

`plugin-catalog.ts` fetches the active plugin catalog (v2; see
[catalog.md](catalog.md)) with timeout, redirect rejection, size cap, and cache.
`plugin-catalog-validation.ts` validates the catalog strictly. `plugin-package.ts`
downloads the ZIP from `zip.openpets.dev/plugins/`, **verifies SHA-256**,
restricts ZIP size/entries, extracts the **root manifest only**, checks
manifest↔catalog consistency, and installs to `userData/plugins/{id}`. It also
owns safe uninstall path resolution.

### Local development

`plugin-local-loader.ts` validates a selected local folder and snapshots the
manifest, entry file, and declared assets into `userData/plugins-dev/{id}`, with
symlink/path/size protections. In the installed desktop app, authors use
**Plugins → Developer Mode → Load unpacked plugin folder**; OpenPets persists the
original source folder, watches it, and re-snapshots/reloads after edits. The
repo dev build still supports maintainer-only env paths with
`OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_ROOTS` / `OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_PATHS` and
`pnpm dev:desktop:plugins`. See [development.md](development.md).

## Authoring workflow (end to end)

1. **Scaffold**: `openpets plugin new <name> --template <blank|reminder|ambient|ai-chat|tamagotchi|calendar>`
   generates a `manifestVersion: 3` package with `index.js`, `test.js`, README,
   and `locales/en.json`. (`packages/cli/src/plugin-templates.ts`.)
2. **Develop**: write against the SDK ([sdk.md](sdk.md)); hot-load via dev mode.
3. **Test**: `test.js` uses `@open-pets/plugin-sdk/testing` to fake time/events
   and assert descriptor-level effects — no Electron. See [sdk.md](sdk.md).
4. **Validate**: `openpets plugin validate <dir>` checks manifest, permissions,
   SDK compatibility, config field types, network hosts, asset formats/size
   caps, entry files, and HTML panels. (`packages/cli/src/plugin-validate.ts`.)
5. **Package & publish**: see below.

### Calendar Airmail

`openpets.calendar-airmail` is the official Google Calendar companion. Its
configuration selects one of its bundled courier sprites in an animated,
reduced-motion-aware sprite grid; the default is AirDog. This replaces the
previous installed-pet selection: legacy `pet` configuration is ignored, and a
missing or invalid courier resolves to the declared default rather than a pet
fallback. It reads the user's **primary calendar** only, expands recurring
instances, and deliberately omits all-day events in this first release. It
delivers an airmail reminder ten minutes before an event and again at its start.

Connection begins only from the plugin's explicit sign-in command. The official
Google Cloud **Desktop app** OAuth credential used for the release includes its
client ID and the client secret required by Google's token endpoint; the user
then selects the plugin's Connect command and completes the host-managed
browser/loopback PKCE flow. The plugin requests only Google Calendar's event
read-only scope and may contact only `www.googleapis.com`. The host persists
the OAuth session, including this credential when supplied, in encrypted
plugin-scoped secret storage. While Google's
consent screen is in Testing, add intended users as test users. Broad external
distribution requires Google consent-screen verification.

Calendar Airmail reconciles a bounded rolling view of the primary calendar and
keeps durable occurrence and delivery state so reminders recover across app
restart, sleep, configuration changes, and reconnection. Temporary network
failures retain the last known schedule. If authorization is revoked or expires
and cannot be refreshed, the plugin clears its Google session and outstanding
delivery schedule, reports that reconnection is required, and the user should
run its sign-in command again.
If Google Calendar API access is denied, it keeps the connection and existing
deliveries, shows an API/account-access warning, and records only the bounded,
sanitized HTTP status and Google error classification in plugin diagnostics.
Its status shows the synced upcoming-event count and the next event's local
start and Airmail reminder times (or that no timed events were found), so users
can confirm the calendar data it sees. When future timed events remain today,
the pet menu also shows disabled summary rows for the remaining-today count and
the next event's local time and relative countdown; it hides those rows when
there are none. The pet menu exposes **Connect Google Calendar** only while
disconnected; once connected, it instead exposes **Sync now**, **Test
delivery**, and **Disconnect Google Calendar**.
Its manifest requests only `ui:delivery`, `auth`, `network`, `schedule`,
`storage`, `commands`, and `status`.

## Packaging, catalog & release validation

The release path is documented operationally in `web/docs/plugin-publishing.md`
and gated by the validators in [testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md).
The command surface (run from repo root):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm plugins:check` | Validate the package plan (dry-run, no writes) |
| `pnpm plugins:package` | Write local catalog files + ZIP staging (no R2 upload) |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-release` | **Release gate** — catch production-breaking mistakes before shipping |
| `pnpm plugins:publish` | Generate + upload ZIPs to R2 |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-live` | Post-deploy validation against the live catalog |
| `pnpm plugins:deploy` | Deploy the web catalog |
| `pnpm plugins:release` | Full package → validate → publish → deploy → live-validate sequence |
| `pnpm plugins:test` | Run plugin locale checks + official/community plugin harness tests |

The release validator exists to catch exactly the production-breakers
`plugins:check` alone misses: unresolved `$t:` names/descriptions in catalog
cards, missing ZIPs, SHA mismatches, missing `locales/en.json`, missing declared
assets/entry files, and catalog/package drift. **Always run it before shipping a
plugin release.**

`plugins:package` and `plugins:publish` read both `plugins/official/` and
`plugins/community/`. Catalog v2 entries include `publisherType` so the app and
site can distinguish reviewed first-party plugins from community submissions.
Community plugins follow the same release validation but cannot set `bundled`.

The tracked producer is `scripts/sync-plugins.mjs`; `web/` itself is an ignored,
separately deployed workspace and is not the source of the release logic. The
producer enforces the desktop SDK v3 manifest contract (including config-field
semantics and asset/panel limits), validates every referenced path, and rejects
traversal, Windows-reserved path segments, source symlinks, and symlinked output
ancestry. It resolves English `$t:` card text, sanitizes catalog SVGs, and writes
store-only deterministic ZIPs in fixed UTF-8 byte order to
`web/.data/plugin-zips/`. The release validator independently checks each ZIP's
EOCD/central-directory structure, matching local headers, bounds, sizes, and
CRC-32 before reading its manifest. The producer also writes plugin catalog v2
plus the empty v1 compatibility catalog under
`web/public/plugins/`. `plugins:check` exercises the deterministic ZIP and path
safety contracts before building the same plan without writing artifacts.

Determinism includes checkout bytes. Root `.gitattributes` forces LF for plugin
JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, SVG, and `.openpets-approved-hosts` files and marks
WebP assets binary, so `core.autocrlf` cannot change reviewed-tree or ZIP hashes.
When a plugin source format is added, classify it there before relying on its
hash. The producer also validates emitted catalog v2 entries against the
desktop field limits, including 80-character versions, 253-character network
hosts, and 100,000-character SVG icon data URLs.

### Community plugin provenance, pending submissions, and owner safe updates

To lock down the integrity and security of community-submitted plugins without
modifying the app-facing `catalog.v2.json` schema, OpenPets uses website-only
sidecars:

- `web/public/plugins/provenance.json` — reviewed provenance for installable
  community plugins.
- `web/public/plugins/submissions.json` — pending external GitHub submissions
  shown on the website but not installable yet.

Their tracked sources are `plugins/community/provenance.json` and
`plugins/community/submissions.json`; packaging validates and copies them into
the ignored web output. Provenance keys must exactly match the current community
source folders, while a pending submission must not also be installable.

`provenance.json` maps plugin IDs to their verified upstream metadata:
- `publisher`: The GitHub username or organization owning the plugin.
- `sourceUrl`: The canonical upstream GitHub repository URL.
- `sourceSubdirectory`: Subdirectory in the repository containing the plugin manifest and files (if applicable).
- `sourceCommit`: The specific git commit SHA that was reviewed and approved.
- `reviewedTreeSha256`: Deterministic digest of every regular file below the reviewed source directory.
- `reviewedAt`: ISO date when the current version/commit was reviewed.
- `updatePolicy`: Can be `safe-auto` (safe for automated publishing of owner updates) or `manual-review` (always requires manual PR review).

`sourceCommit` records the upstream snapshot a maintainer reviewed, while
`reviewedTreeSha256` is the enforced local content boundary. Packaging and
local/live release validation recompute that digest from the checked-out
community directory, so byte drift is detected in shallow/offline CI. They do
not fetch the repository or cryptographically prove that `sourceCommit` owns
those bytes; the reviewer must compare the cited repository, commit, and
subdirectory before recording the digest. Any digest change requires manual
review and an updated commit, digest, and `reviewedAt`.

Pending entries in `submissions.json` are candidates only. They must not appear
in the installable catalog until promoted into `plugins/community/`, packaged,
uploaded to R2, and release-validated.

Plugin owners can publish updates to their plugins without needing a manual PR to the main OpenPets repository. They do this by tag-publishing new releases on their immutable GitHub repository. OpenPets automation periodically validates updates against the following safety rules:
1. **Repository & Publisher Match**: The release must originate from the same owner, repository, and plugin ID registered in `provenance.json`.
2. **Version Increase**: The release version must be a clean semver increase.
3. **No New Permissions/Capabilities**: The update must not request any new `permissions`, new `network.hosts`, new private local API/privileged capabilities, or changes to publisher configuration.
4. **All Tests Pass**: The package must pass all validation gates (manifest, SDK compatibility, locales check, ZIP and SHA matches).

If an update is determined to be **safe**, OpenPets CI/CD automation automatically updates the catalog entry version and re-packages the plugin. If any safety boundary is crossed, the update triggers a `manual-review` block and requires a maintainer to inspect and merge the change.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Plugin marked "broken" | Manifest/action validation failed — check `plugin-diagnostics` / the inspector |
| SDK call silently does nothing | Permission not declared or not approved; or blocked by a global platform setting (audio/voice/quiet hours) |
| Network call rejected | Host not in declared `network` hosts |
| Catalog card shows raw `$t:...` | Missing locale key — `validate-release` should have caught it |
| ZIP install fails | SHA mismatch, non-HTTPS/disallowed host, or oversized/invalid ZIP entries |
| Local plugin won't load | Local loader rejected the folder (symlink/path/size) or manifest isn't at root |
| Icon/image missing | Asset not declared in `assets`, wrong format, or over size cap |

## Where to look first

| Concern | File |
|---------|------|
| Manifest schema/validation | `plugin-manifest.ts`, `plugin-manifest-reader.ts` |
| Orchestration / UI actions | `plugin-service.ts` |
| Runtime / scheduling / broken-state | `plugin-runtime.ts` |
| Sandbox host | `plugin-js-host.ts` |
| Permission + dispatch | `plugin-sdk-bridge.ts` + `plugin-sdk-*.ts` |
| Catalog install/verify | `plugin-catalog.ts`, `plugin-package.ts` |
| Local dev load | `plugin-local-loader.ts` |
| Official plugin examples | `plugins/official/*` |
