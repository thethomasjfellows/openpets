# SuperPlugins: Product Direction

"SuperPlugins" is the **companion-first** direction for OpenPets plugins. Where
[plugins.md](plugins.md) is the platform mechanics and [sdk.md](sdk.md) is the
author API, this doc is the *product* intent: what official plugins should feel
like, which ones ship, what's bundled by default, and how users invoke them.

This is required reading (with [plugins.md](plugins.md)) before plugin platform,
official-plugin, catalog, or plugin-UI work, per `AGENTS.md`. Keep the lineup and
bundling defaults here in sync with `apps/desktop/src/plugin-service.ts` and the
catalog generator when they change.

## The thesis

The pet is a companion, not a control panel. Plugins should make the pet *do
helpful things on its own* — remind you, nudge you, react to your day — using
host-rendered surfaces (bubbles, alerts, pinned HUDs, status text, right-click
commands), not by bolting bespoke windows onto the pet. Concretely:

- **Host-rendered, descriptor-driven.** Plugins describe; the host renders. No
  injecting UI into pet windows. (Enforced by the SDK — see [sdk.md](sdk.md).)
- **Zero-JSON configuration.** Every setting is a typed `configSchema` field
  rendered as a form. Users never edit JSON.
- **Localized by default.** Manifests use `$t:` and code uses `ctx.t()`; ship
  `locales/en.json`. See [i18n.md](i18n.md).
- **Stateful and resilient.** Reminders, routines, focus sessions, and virtual-pet
  stats live in `ctx.storage` and reconcile after restart/sleep.
- **Appliance, not platform knob.** Prefer many small, enable-and-go plugins over
  one big configurable one. (This is a standing product preference — a single
  plugin should explain itself by name and do one thing well.)

### Companion contribution strategy

OpenPets core owns the conversational pet: per-pet personality, the user's
minimal explicit profile, roughly 24 hours of recent memory, provider choice,
speech, and the final decision to initiate a check-in. SuperPlugins remain
modular domain experts. With `companion:context` and separate host consent they
may offer expiring facts or opportunities, but they never write the pet's final
line, force a check-in, select a provider, or add durable/core memory.

This keeps habits, reminders, focus, calendars, and future screen awareness out
of the core app while still letting the pet feel informed. Normal and sensitive
plugin context have separate consent gates. Screen awareness remains a future
explicit plugin boundary; the current reserved switch collects nothing. A
future Screenpipe plugin may contribute bounded, expiring observations through
`companion:context` after sensitive-context consent, but does not inherit the
user's Codex MCP servers or become a callable Codex tool merely because Codex is
the selected Brain.

Focus Buddy is the pilot for this contract. An active, unpaused focus session
offers one low-urgency mid-session opportunity after a delay, with session-
scoped expiry/dedupe/cooldown. Pausing or ending removes it. The host still
applies quiet hours, Rarely/Sometimes/Often policy, provider readiness, current
activity, and original-wording generation, so “start a focus timer” never means
“guarantee an interruption.”

## Right-click action strategy

The primary way users invoke plugins is the **default pet's right-click menu**.
Enabled plugins surface their registered `commands` under a Plugins submenu, so a
plugin's value is one click away on the pet itself. Plugins should register
clear, verb-first commands (e.g. "Start focus session", "Add reminder") rather
than burying everything in settings. Bubble buttons and pinned HUDs handle
in-the-moment interactions (snooze, done, feed).

## Official plugin lineup

Official plugins live in `plugins/official/` and are the reviewed catalog set.
Current lineup (verified 2026-07-17 against the folder + manifests):

| Plugin id | What it is |
|-----------|------------|
| `openpets.reminders` | Quick reminders with due/missed alerts, snooze/done, status, optional notify/sound |
| `openpets.virtual-pet` | Tamagotchi-style state machine (hunger/energy/happiness/affection), pinned HUD, click handling |
| `openpets.focus-buddy` | Focus-session timers with status/completion feedback and a consented low-urgency mid-session Companion opportunity |
| `openpets.water-reminder` | Hydration reminder loop with configurable cadence |
| `openpets.day-routine` | Morning/evening daily check-ins |
| `openpets.mood-check-in` | Mood logging/check-in companion |
| `openpets.launch-buddy` | Launch/checklist companion for shipping moments |
| `openpets.magic-8-ball` | Command-driven decision/fortune responses |
| `openpets.fortune-cookie` | Periodic or command-triggered fortunes |
| `openpets.calendar-airmail` | Google primary-calendar reminders delivered by a selected bundled courier sprite ten minutes before and at event start |

`plugins/official/codemap.md` carries the per-plugin SDK-surface breakdown.

## Community plugin lineup

Community plugins live in `plugins/community/`. They are public catalog plugins
that pass the same packaging, ZIP, SHA, locale, and manifest checks as official
plugins, but they are labeled `publisherType: "community"` and are not bundled or
enabled by default.

Current community lineup:

| Plugin id | What it is |
|-----------|------------|
| `openpets.higgsfield-watch` | Watches Higgsfield generation jobs and lets the pet report status changes |
| `openpets.spotify-buddy` | Connects to Spotify for playback-aware pet reactions and commands |
| `openpets.walkabout` | Makes the pet roam the screen, follow the cursor, or patrol back and forth |

> Drift note: `web/docs/plugin-publishing.md` still lists an **older** lineup
> (`ambient-companion`, `break-buddy`, `pet-pal`, `github-notifications`). That
> runbook is stale — trust this folder + the catalog generator. Tracked in the
> root `improvements.md`.

## Bundling & default-enabled

Defaults are defined in `apps/desktop/src/plugin-service.ts` and the bundled
plugins are shipped as packaging extra-resources (`plugins/official` → packaged
`plugins/official`, enforced by `check-packaging-contract.ts`):

- **Bundled with the app**: `openpets.reminders`, `openpets.focus-buddy`,
  `openpets.launch-buddy`, `openpets.virtual-pet` (`bundledOfficialPluginIds`).
- **Enabled by default**: `openpets.reminders`, `openpets.focus-buddy`,
  `openpets.launch-buddy` (`bundledEnabledByDefault`).
- **Bundled but disabled by default**: `openpets.virtual-pet`; users can enable it
  from the Plugins page.
- **`staleBundledPluginIds`**: an explicit cleanup list of plugin ids that were
  bundled in past builds and must be removed on upgrade (e.g. `ambient-companion`,
  `break-buddy`, `focus-buddy`-as-bundled, `github-notifications`, `pomodoro`,
  `pet-pal`, `wander-buddy`, …). This is how the forward-only direction is
  enforced for plugins: old bundled state is actively reaped, not left to rot.

Everything else in the lineup is **available via the catalog** but not bundled —
the user installs and enables it from the Plugins page.

> If you change what's bundled or enabled by default, update both the constants
> in `plugin-service.ts` and this doc, and verify the packaging contract still
> passes ([testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md)).

## Relationship to the catalog

Official and community plugins are packaged into catalog **v2** artifacts and
ZIPs on R2 (see [catalog.md](catalog.md)). Current runtime work should not
optimize for the legacy v1 catalog (kept as an empty compatibility shim). The
packaging + release gates are in [testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md).
