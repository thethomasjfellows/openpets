# Desktop App

The desktop app (`apps/desktop/`) is the heart of OpenPets: the only long-lived
process, owner of all state, windows, the tray, pet rendering, the plugin
runtime, and the local IPC server that agents talk to. This doc explains its
process model, the major subsystems, and the rules that keep it secure and
stable. For the pet rendering specifics see [pets.md](pets.md); for the IPC wire
contract see [ipc.md](ipc.md); for plugins see [plugins.md](plugins.md).

Source map: `apps/desktop/codemap.md` and `apps/desktop/src/codemap.md` are the
authoritative file-by-file maps. This doc is the narrative on top of them.

## Process model

Electron gives us a **main process** and multiple **renderer processes**. In
OpenPets:

- The **main process** (`src/main.ts` and the modules it orchestrates) holds all
  authority: state, lifecycle, tray, windows, IPC, leases, catalog/install,
  plugins, i18n.
- **Renderers** are sandboxed and powerless by default. Each gets a *narrow*
  preload bridge exposing only the APIs it needs:
  - The **Control Center** renderer (the React/Tailwind UI) via
    `control-center-preload.cjs`.
  - **Pet windows** (transparent, frameless, always-on-top) via `pet-preload.cjs`.
  - **Plugin JS hosts** and **plugin panels** via `plugin-sdk-preload.cjs`.

There is **no default main window**. The app is tray-first: tray actions open
the singleton Control Center routed to a specific page. A single-instance lock
(`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`) focuses the existing instance instead of
launching a second one.

## Startup sequence

`main.ts` runs a deterministic bootstrap (see `src/codemap.md` for the exact
order): install lifecycle handlers → initialize the logger → initialize app
state → initialize voice, Companion settings/memory, plugin-platform and host-AI
settings → install the internal UI protocol/handlers → create the tray → start
the local IPC server → create the host voice/Companion platform → initialize the
plugin service (with the Electron JS host) → optionally show the default pet.
Shutdown cancels microphone, proactive, provider, speech, and Companion work
before stopping the plugin service, IPC server, and pet windows.

Key files: `main.ts` (entry/bootstrap), `lifecycle.ts` (app events + cleanup),
`state.ts` (shell pause flag).

## Linux display backend (Ozone/Wayland)

On Linux, `main.ts` appends `--ozone-platform=x11` **before** `app` is ready, so
the app always runs under x11/XWayland. This is required because OpenPets pets
depend on programmatic top-level window positioning (`setPosition`/`setBounds`)
and z-order control (`setAlwaysOnTop`); native Wayland forbids clients from
positioning or restacking their own toplevels, which silently breaks motion,
gravity, walkabout, drag, and always-on-top stacking. The forcing is
unconditional (it overrides even an explicit `--ozone-platform=wayland`) so a
mistaken launch flag cannot disable pet movement.

The escape hatch is the environment variable `OPENPETS_ALLOW_WAYLAND=1`: when
set, the app honors the system default backend (or an explicit
`--ozone-platform`) and emits a one-time `warn("app", ...)` at startup (after the
startup-begin log) stating that positioning, gravity, walkabout, and drag are
unsupported under native Wayland and how to restore full functionality. The
pet-drag path keys off this same effective backend via
`isEffectiveWaylandBackend()` in `pet-window.ts`, which is evaluated at
window-creation time (after the switch is applied) and cached. The pure backend
decision (platform + `--ozone-platform` + `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`)
is factored into `computeEffectiveWaylandBackend()` in `wayland-backend.ts`;
`pet-window.ts` delegates to it and owns only the cache.

The x11-forcing branch and the `OPENPETS_ALLOW_WAYLAND` opt-out are asserted by
`check-packaging-contract.ts`, so this behavior cannot silently regress.

On Windows, the shell silently strips `HWND_TOPMOST` from other windows when an
app enters fullscreen (browser video, games) and never restores it — and no
Electron event fires when it happens, so the `show`/`restore` re-assertions
never run and the pet stays buried until manually toggled. Pet windows
therefore re-assert always-on-top on a 1s interval while visible (the
shell's demotion sweep re-strips the flag every ~2-4s while a fullscreen app
is foreground, so the cadence bounds the buried time to under a second),
dropping
Electron's cached always-on-top flag first — Electron short-circuits
`setAlwaysOnTop(true)` when its cached state already matches, so without the
cache-bust the re-assert never reaches the OS
(`createBasePetWindow` in `pet-window.ts`); the call is a cheap no-op while the
flag is intact, and keeping the pet above fullscreen content matches the
explicit macOS `visibleOnFullScreen: true` behavior.

Separately, Chromium's native window occlusion tracker considers every window
on a display occluded while a fullscreen app is active there and stops
painting it — a transparent pet window goes blank even with its z-order
intact. `main.ts` disables `CalculateNativeWinOcclusion` on Windows so the
pet keeps rendering during fullscreen video and games.

## Subsystems

### Tray & windows

- `tray.ts` builds the tray icon (`assets.ts` loads `assets/tray-icon.png`,
  keeps it as a full-color image, and falls back to a generated icon if the
  asset is missing) and the context menu,
  including update status and route-targeted Control Center entries and a "open
  logs" action.
- `windows.ts` is the Control Center coordinator: it creates the hardened
  `BrowserWindow`, loads the Vite renderer (dev) or packaged `dist/renderer`
  (prod), targets a route, registers all renderer-facing IPC handlers, builds
  the Dashboard snapshot, and defines the internal asset protocols.
  Route requests can carry `{ route, petId, section, notice }`; a pet's
  **Talk to this pet** menu item opens `route: "pets"`, selects that installed
  pet, and focuses its `section: "companion"` composer. Invalid/uninstalled pets
  resolve to a bounded `pet-unavailable` notice instead of an arbitrary route.
- `display.ts` provides screen-geometry helpers for positioning pet windows,
  including the permissive `clampToNearestDisplayIfOffscreen` helper that allows
  pets to roam across display seams while only snapping when fully off-screen.

### Control Center (renderer)

The React/Tailwind UI under `src/renderer/`. Pages: **Dashboard, Pets,
Integrations, Plugins, Settings**. It is a pure consumer of main-process
snapshots and actions exposed over the preload bridge — it holds no privileged
capability of its own. The renderer is the only "frontend" in scope for these
docs (the `web/` marketing site is out of scope). See
`src/renderer/src/codemap.md` for component structure.

The selected installed-pet detail owns `PetCompanionPanel`: disclosure and
enablement, the pet-specific personality, the small shared user profile,
provider/frequency selection, independent context toggles, typed composer,
push-to-talk controls, recent-memory clearing, and Companion disablement. The
Control Center never calls a provider directly and never receives credentials,
raw microphone audio, or the persisted recent-memory file.

### Pet windows

Pet rendering lives in `pet-window.ts` plus the two controllers
(`default-pet-controller.ts`, `agent-pet-controller.ts`) and the motion/mapping
helpers. This is covered in depth in [pets.md](pets.md).

Pet windows also own the presentation endpoints for the host-level voice
platform. When **Read speech bubbles aloud** is enabled in Settings, a newly
presented plain-text transient bubble enters `VoiceOutputService`, which resolves
the global or per-pet provider/voice selection. System Voice uses renderer
`speechSynthesis`; PocketTTS, OpenAI-compatible TTS, and ElevenLabs return
bounded audio to a separate voice-only playback element. Interruption, queueing,
and cancellation never stop the existing plugin-audio channel. Narration is
default-off, best-effort, quiet-hours aware, and deduplicated per pet window;
the visual bubble remains authoritative.

Control Center → Settings → Voice stores non-secret configuration in
`openpets-voice-settings.json`. API keys are stored through the encrypted host
secrets store and IPC exposes only boolean key status. PocketTTS is not bundled:
run its separately installed service and configure its loopback URL (normally
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`); the adapter sends multipart `text` and `voice_url` to
`POST /tts`. Provider responses are MIME-checked, streamed through a 10 MiB cap,
and never expose credentials or raw provider payloads to renderers.

Push-to-talk uses one host-owned capture service and one microphone owner. The
privacy-indicator window is shown only after a media track is live and remains
until all tracks stop; pet poses and start/stop cues mirror listening state.
Raw audio stays main-process side and is bounded before transcription. Optional
Codex conversation uses `codex exec --json` and session UUID resume events—not
terminal scraping—and owns cancellable child processes per pet session. Wake
word health intentionally reports unavailable and cannot be enabled until a
local runtime/model clears packaging, license, signing, resource, and teardown
validation.

### Companion conversations

`voice-platform.ts` owns the shared Companion runtime alongside voice output:
`CompanionOrchestrator`, the Codex and host-AI targets, push-to-talk handoff, and
`CompanionProactiveService`. Typed messages and transcribed PTT messages use the
same prompt construction, cancellation, bubble, recent-memory, and optional TTS
path. Runtime sessions are pet-scoped and reset when the selected target changes;
an invalid resumed Codex session is retried once without the stale session.

Companion starts disabled with consent version `0`. The first enable writes one
atomic disclosed state: Companion enabled, recent memory enabled, gentle
check-ins enabled at **Sometimes**, while plugin context, sensitive plugin
context, screen context, and wake listening remain off. Later disable/re-enable
cycles preserve the user's independently reversible choices. Screen context is
a reserved consent bit only—this build does not collect or send screen content.
Wake is displayed as unavailable and cannot be enabled through the UI.

Host-owned persistence is deliberately separate from installed-pet app state:

- `openpets-companion-settings.json` — consent, selected target, explicit user
  profile (name, preferred address, up to five goals), per-installed-pet
  personality, memory/proactivity/context/wake choices.
- `openpets-companion-memory.json` — rolling displayed conversation. Startup
  rewrites it after pruning malformed/expired/over-limit entries. Retention is
  24 hours, with global, per-pet, prompt-entry, text, and file-size bounds.
- `openpets-host-ai-settings.json` — provider, model, and optional base URL for
  Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama-compatible completion/transcription paths. On
  first launch after the split, a configured legacy `ai` block is migrated out
  of `openpets-plugin-platform.json` and removed from that file. The old
  plugin-platform settings API projects the host settings for compatibility but
  no longer creates a second source of truth. API keys remain in the host
  secrets store; renderer IPC exposes only boolean key status.

`CompanionProactiveService` evaluates once after startup and then every five
minutes for the visible, unpaused default pet. It derives local day parts and
activity hints, can express morning/midday/evening/night posture without a
bubble, and considers host time prompts, explicit goals, and eligible plugin
opportunities. Quiet hours, an active interaction, provider health, daily caps,
per-plugin caps, dedupe, and minimum spacing all suppress delivery. Rarely,
Sometimes, and Often currently cap host check-ins at 1/3/5 per local day with
minimum spacing of 6 hours/3 hours/90 minutes; these are ceilings, not schedules.

The main process logs bounded decisions under the `companion` scope: settings
changes, target/kind/input sizes, selected memory/fact counts, cancellations,
proactive suppression reasons, and display/failure outcomes. It does not log
prompts, responses, personality, goals, plugin fact text, credentials, or raw
audio.

### Local IPC server

`local-ipc.ts` runs a `net.Server` over a Unix socket / Windows named pipe /
TCP, routes a versioned JSON protocol, and writes a discovery file so clients
can find it. The lease manager (`lease-manager.ts`) sits behind it. Full
contract in [ipc.md](ipc.md).

**Pet fallback notification:** when an agent requests a specific pet via
`--pet <id>` and that pet is not installed (or is invalid/broken), the lease
manager silently falls back to the default pet and window confinement does not
activate. `pet-fallback-notify.ts` detects this condition and fires a native
macOS notification (once per unique pet ID) so the user knows why confinement
is inactive. The notification includes the command to use once the pet is
installed.

### App state

`app-state.ts` persists a versioned JSON document under
`userData/openpets-state.json` using atomic temp-write + rename. It holds
installed pets, the default-pet config, reaction→animation overrides, onboarding
state, locale preference, the pet pool preference (ordered pet list +
`petPoolEnabled` toggle), and display-roaming preferences (`petConfinementEnabled`,
`petCrossDisplayEnabled`). It also stores the default-off
`readSpeechBubblesAloud` accessibility preference. `app-state-core.ts` holds
pure helpers (scale options, onboarding and narration-preference normalization)
that are testable without Electron.

#### Pet pool preference

The **pet pool** is an ordered list of installed pets plus a master enable/disable
toggle (`petPoolEnabled`, default `true`), both configurable in Control Center →
Settings → General. When enabled, the lease manager uses the ordered list to
assign a distinct pet to each concurrent agent session that does not explicitly
request one via `--pet <id>`. Slot 1 is the primary/default pet; slot 2 onwards
are assigned to additional sessions in order. When all pool slots are taken,
further sessions receive a random eligible pet (installed, non-broken, not the
built-in default). Slots free up when their session ends. `--pet <id>` bypasses
the pool entirely. When disabled, all sessions without `--pet` share the single
default pet (legacy behavior). Pool assignment is pure lease logic and works on
all platforms.

**Toggle side-effects:** disabling the pool immediately despawns all active pool
pets (releases their leases, which closes their windows). Re-enabling respawns a
pool pet for every session whose client PID is still alive — those sessions
acquire new leases and their windows reopen. Sessions whose processes have already
terminated are skipped. This is handled by `dispatchPoolToggle` in `local-ipc.ts`,
wired from the `update-preferences` IPC handler in `windows.ts`.

**Session teardown:** a periodic liveness sweep (the `local-ipc.ts` cleanup timer
calling `lease-manager.ts`'s `checkPidLiveness`) releases an agent pet's lease —
and so closes its window — once the owning session is gone. It probes the
**terminal owner PID** (when known) as well as the client PID, so an orphaned but
still-running client can't keep a pet alive indefinitely. Expiring the 15s TTL is
the backstop; liveness is the prompt path.

See [agent-integrations.md](agent-integrations.md) for the
full behavioral description.

### Plugin subsystem

A large, self-contained subsystem (`plugin-*.ts`) covering manifests, state,
runtime, the sandboxed JS host, the permission-checked SDK bridge, catalog/local
install, assets, panels, diagnostics, and platform settings. Fully documented in
[plugins.md](plugins.md) and [sdk.md](sdk.md).

The plugin subsystem also owns **display deliveries**: a lazy, transparent,
host-owned surface used by `ctx.ui.delivery`. A delivery is rendered as a single
courier-and-banner surface on the cursor display, rather than as a spawned pet
or a plugin-controlled overlay. Each display advances a bounded FIFO queue;
expiry, dismissal, display removal, plugin reload/disable/uninstall, and app
shutdown are host lifecycle events. The host animates the declared courier strip
and owns its layout; plugins only supply a trusted sprite reference and text.

Calendar Airmail's configuration is a plugin-exclusive courier picker. It is an
accessible animated sprite grid whose selected/hovered/focused cards animate,
while reduced-motion users see a static first frame. It does not select, preview,
or validate installed pets; its bundled courier sprites remain available wherever
the plugin is installed.

### Agent setup

`agent-setup.ts` detects installed agents and runs configuration actions (MCP
add/replace/remove, hooks install/uninstall/doctor, memory file install),
delegating to the integration packages. Its Codex path resolves the packaged
`@open-pets/codex` hook adapter and `@open-pets/mcp` entry from ASAR-unpacked
resources, exposes one Connect/Repair/Disconnect lifecycle, and performs
replacement-first legacy migration. Codex command JSON is preserved internally
for exact ownership checks, while renderer snapshots format home paths as `~`
and omit packaged runtime locations. The modal keeps connection controls at the
top and places command overrides in a collapsed troubleshooting disclosure.
`claude-memory.ts` manages the Claude
instructions file. See [agent-integrations.md](agent-integrations.md).

### Catalog & installation

`catalog.ts` fetches the pet catalog (v3 paginated, with v2/fixture fallback);
`pet-installation.ts` downloads + validates + extracts pet ZIPs; `codex-pets.ts`
imports locally-developed pets. See [catalog.md](catalog.md) and [pets.md](pets.md).

### i18n

`src/i18n/` resolves the active locale and serves localized host UI text and pet
reaction speech, with English fallback. See [i18n.md](i18n.md).

### Updates

`update-checker.ts` polls GitHub releases and surfaces update status to the tray
and Dashboard; `update-version.ts` does version parsing/comparison.

### Logging

`logger.ts` provides scoped, structured logging (scopes: `app`, `ipc`, `lease`,
`pet.*`, `state`, `tray`, `ui`, `companion`) with log rotation (~2MB) and redaction of
sensitive data, written to `userData/logs/openpets.log`. Renderer diagnostics
should be routed here so failures are visible in the log file, not only DevTools
(see the logging guidance in `AGENTS.md`).

### Desktop analytics

The desktop app has a privacy-preserving PostHog analytics client in
`analytics.ts`. It runs from the main process only, posts to the self-hosted
OpenPets PostHog project, and is disabled in dev unless
`OPENPETS_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=1` is set. Users control capture in Settings with the
**Share privacy-preserving usage analytics** toggle. Remote analytics uses a
random local `distinctId`; local app state also keeps dashboard counters such as
message/reaction totals, per-pet activity counts, first-run/first-reaction
milestone timestamps, and the consent value.

Analytics events are intentionally product/health level: app startup, first run,
Control Center opens, pet catalog/install/customization flows, bounded
integration activity, IPC connection/lease health, plugin install/enable/command
usage, catalog/update reliability, and renderer/plugin runtime failures. Do not
send prompts, code, file paths, repo names, terminal commands, pet speech,
clipboard contents, plugin config values, local usernames, hostnames, raw stack
traces, or raw local pet/plugin/command identifiers. Add only bounded enum-style
properties such as platform, app version, locale, source, `integration_type`,
runtime, result, and safe error codes.

## Security model

This is non-negotiable surface area. The app handles remote content (catalogs,
ZIPs) and runs third-party plugin code, so it is defensive by construction:

- **Sandboxed renderers** with `contextIsolation`; capabilities reach them only
  through narrow `contextBridge` preload APIs.
- **Strict CSP**: `default-src 'none'`, inline styles only. Any new
  renderer-visible URL scheme, image source, dev endpoint, or internal protocol
  **must** be added to the CSP in *both* `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` and
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`. Common pet image protocols:
  `openpets-codex:`, `openpets-installed:`, `openpets-pet-preview:`, and
  `openpets-plugin-asset:`. Forgetting the CSP makes images fall back to the
  default pet even when install/render logic is correct. (This is a documented,
  easy-to-hit footgun in `AGENTS.md`.)
- **Mock keychain** to avoid OS credential prompts.
- **IPC network security**: TCP mode is restricted to loopback/private
  addresses; public IPs and hostnames are rejected. See [ipc.md](ipc.md).
- **Defensive I/O**: atomic writes everywhere; path-traversal and symlink checks
  on every filesystem boundary; strict ZIP entry validation (`zip-safety.ts`).
- **Plugin sandbox**: plugins run in hidden, session-partitioned BrowserWindows
  with navigation/window-open hardening and permission-gated SDK calls. See
  [plugins.md](plugins.md).

- **Trusted plugin assets**: `openpets-plugin-asset:` serves only an enabled,
  exact-version JavaScript plugin's declared sprite. The protocol accepts only a
  narrow sprite route, resolves it beneath the real install root, rechecks WebP
  dimensions against manifest frame metadata, and returns no filesystem paths to
  a renderer. Delivery documents have their own restrictive CSP and can load
  only this protocol (or data URLs).

## Packaging

`electron-builder.yml` configures cross-platform packaging (macOS/Windows/Linux)
with ASAR. Bundled mode unpacks the integration binaries from ASAR so hooks/MCP
can spawn them. `scripts/release-local.mjs` automates a macOS-local release with
a GitHub draft. See [development.md](development.md) for the release flow.
