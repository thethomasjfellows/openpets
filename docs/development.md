# Developer Experience (DX)

How to set up, build, run, and release the workspace. This doc is the practical
"how do I work in this repo" companion; testing and production-validity gates get
their own doc, [testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md).

## Layout & toolchain

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) over `apps/*` and
  `packages/*`. Package manager pinned to `pnpm@11.x`; Node `>=20`.
- **ESM + TypeScript everywhere**: every package is `"type": "module"` with dual
  type exports; internal links use `workspace:*`.
- **`web/` uses Bun + Nuxt** and is a separate, ignored toolchain — its own
  commands run from `web/` with Bun. The tracked root plugin producer is
  `scripts/sync-plugins.mjs`; it materializes plugin catalogs and ZIP staging
  under `web/` before the separate deploy. Only the data/catalog side is in
  scope here (see [catalog.md](catalog.md)).
- **Versioning**: packages align around SDK v3 / `manifestVersion 3`. The
  workspace version is in the root `package.json` (`3.1.0` at time of writing).
- **Plugin checkout bytes**: root `.gitattributes` fixes current plugin text
  formats to LF and WebP to binary. Update those narrow rules when adding a new
  plugin file format because reviewed-tree and ZIP hashes use raw checkout bytes.

The authoritative structural map is the root `codemap.md` plus per-folder
`codemap.md` files; read those before editing a subsystem.

## Root command surface

All from the repo root unless noted (full list in root `package.json`):

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `pnpm build` | Build every package (`pnpm -r build`) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check every package |
| `pnpm check` | Per-package `check` (typecheck + build + contract checks) |
| `pnpm test` | Build, then run each package's tests |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | Run the desktop app in dev |
| `pnpm dev:desktop:control-center` | Dev with renderer/Control Center focus |
| `pnpm dev:desktop:plugins` | Dev with official plugins hot-loaded |
| `pnpm package:desktop` / `:dir` | Build + package the desktop app (full / unpacked dir) |
| `pnpm release:desktop` | macOS-local release automation (GitHub draft) |
| `pnpm release:npm` | Publish npm packages |
| `pnpm plugins:*` | Plugin test/validate/package/publish/deploy (see below) |

### Plugin DX commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `openpets plugin new <name> --template <t>` | Scaffold an SDK v3 plugin |
| `openpets plugin validate <dir>` | Validate a plugin locally |
| `pnpm plugins:test` | Locale checks + official-plugin harness tests |
| `pnpm plugins:package:test` | Deterministic/strict ZIP, manifest parity, reviewed digest, and safe path/symlink producer contracts |
| `pnpm plugins:check` | Dry-run the catalog package plan |
| `pnpm plugins:package` | Build catalog + ZIP staging (no upload) |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-release` | Pre-ship release gate |
| `pnpm plugins:publish` | Upload ZIPs to R2 |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-live` | Post-deploy live check |
| `pnpm plugins:deploy` | Deploy the web catalog |

See [plugins.md](plugins.md) for the authoring workflow and
[testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md) for what the validators
catch.

## Running the desktop app

- `pnpm dev:desktop` launches Electron against the TypeScript source with the
  Vite renderer dev server.
- Plugin authors using the installed app do not need this repo: open **Plugins →
  Developer Mode → Load unpacked plugin folder** to validate, snapshot, watch, and
  reload a standalone plugin folder.
- For plugin work, `pnpm dev:desktop:plugins` points the local loader at both
  `plugins/official` and `plugins/dev` (via `OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_ROOTS`) so
  official plugins and in-progress dev plugins hot-load when working on OpenPets
  itself.
- Logs land in `userData/logs/openpets.log` (path varies by OS). Route renderer
  diagnostics into the app log, not just DevTools (per `AGENTS.md`).

### The CSP footgun

Any renderer-visible URL scheme, image source, dev endpoint, or internal
protocol must be added to the CSP in **both** `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` and
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`. Symptom of forgetting: images fall back
to the default pet even though install/render logic is correct. See
[desktop.md](desktop.md).

## Logging-as-DX

When working on renderer/IPC/catalog/plugin/pet-window behavior, add **targeted,
scoped** logs as part of the change (data shapes, selected ids, load/error
states, boundary decisions). Avoid noisy permanent logs, secrets, full payload
dumps, or logging inside animation/render loops. The logger
(`apps/desktop/src/logger.ts`) provides scopes and redaction. This is an explicit
repo convention (`AGENTS.md`), not optional polish.

## Release flows

### npm packages

`pnpm release:npm` (`scripts/release-npm.mjs`) orchestrates publishing the
workspace packages. Packages must build and pass `check`/`test` first.

### Desktop app

`pnpm release:desktop` (`apps/desktop/scripts/release-local.mjs`) does a
macOS-local build + packaging and creates a GitHub draft release.
`electron-builder` handles cross-platform packaging; bundled mode unpacks the
integration CLIs, bundles `plugins/official`, and copies one validated
target-specific Sherpa wake bundle outside ASAR. Native wake helpers are prepared
on their target OS (macOS can prepare both macOS architectures); release assembly
requires prebuilt validated Windows/Linux bundles instead of cross-packaging a
macOS helper. Run `wake:prepare`, `wake:smoke`, build main, then
`wake:stage` for a manual target build. Smoke evidence is hash-bound to the exact
helper and manifest. Ordinary `package`/`package:dir` commands reject cross-target
arguments and package only the current host/architecture (using the Windows
`pnpm.cmd` shim when needed). On macOS, an ordinary local package keeps a real
Developer ID signature unchanged; when electron-builder produces an ad-hoc
signature instead, the packaging runner replaces its changing CDHash-only
designated requirement with the stable `dev.openpets.app` identifier. This lets
macOS privacy grants follow future local rebuilds installed at the canonical
Applications path instead of treating every build as a different app. The
release script stages each explicitly attested target immediately before its build, rejects
native evidence from different helper build inputs, and validates the resources
actually emitted after each target's builder run. The packaging contract
revalidates the installed bundle — see
[testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md).

### Web catalog

Pet and plugin catalog deploys run from `web/` with Bun (`bun run deploy`,
`pnpm plugins:deploy`). Plugin generation itself runs from the root through the
tracked `scripts/sync-plugins.mjs`; `plugins:package` writes local artifacts and
`plugins:publish` additionally uploads ZIPs with Wrangler. Catalog
generation/verification is in [catalog.md](catalog.md) and the runbooks under
`web/docs/`.

## Cross-platform & Linux testing

- An **Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 VMware/Vagrant VM** exists for Linux GUI testing.
  Details and host-side commands are in `AGENTS.md` (VM dir
  `/Volumes/external/vmware/ubuntu24`; guest checkout `/home/vagrant/src/openpets`;
  helpers `cdpets` + `openpets-dx`). Use the **isolated guest clone**, never the
  mounted macOS checkout (platform-specific `node_modules`).
- Use the VM to validate Linux/Wayland renderer, tray, pet-window drag, IPC,
  plugin, and packaging behavior.
- **WSL** cross-platform IPC (WSL client → Windows host over private TCP) is part
  of the protocol — see [ipc.md](ipc.md).

## Code intelligence

This repo has a **CodeGraph** index (`.codegraph/`) and an MCP server
(`codegraph_*` tools) — a tree-sitter knowledge graph of every symbol/edge/file.
Prefer it for structural questions (who calls X, what breaks if I change Y, where
is Z defined) over grep. Read-only dependency clones for inspecting Electron /
KWin behavior live under `.slim/clonedeps/repos/` (do not edit). Both are
described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Conventions checklist

- Match surrounding code style; keep comment density and naming idiomatic.
- Update the matching `docs/*.md` and `codemap.md` when behavior changes.
- Honor forward-only direction: no legacy compat in current runtime paths.
- Validate at boundaries; atomic writes; reject path traversal/symlinks.
- For plugin/catalog/i18n changes, follow the explicit "update docs / run
  validators" rules in `AGENTS.md`.
