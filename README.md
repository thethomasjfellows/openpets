## Download OpenPets

**[Download the latest OpenPets desktop release](https://github.com/alvinunreal/openpets/releases/latest)** and launch it. A pet appears immediately; no agent setup required.

- **Desktop pets**: animated companions that idle, wander, react, and keep your workspace from feeling empty.
- **Official plugins**: focus timers, reminders, mood check-ins, mini games, launch shortcuts, hydration nudges, and virtual-pet stats.
- **Plugin SDK v3**: a sandboxed JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for building new pet abilities with permissions, quotas, storage, schedules, commands, panels, events, audio, notifications, and more.
- **Optional agent layer**: Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Pi, and MCP clients can drive local pet reactions without exposing prompts, code, paths, logs, or secrets in speech bubbles.

## Plugin Platform & SDK v3

The OpenPets plugin system offers a secure, developer-friendly SDK (`@open-pets/plugin-sdk`) for creating custom companion behavior.

### Security & Architecture
- **Sandboxed Runtime**: Each JS plugin runs inside a sandboxed BrowserWindow host environment.
- **Host-Rendered UI**: Plugins describe actions, HUDs, and notifications; the desktop host renders them. HTML/JS code cannot render raw HTML or execute arbitrary scripting inside a pet window.
- **Permissions Model**: Permissions must be declared in the manifest and approved by the user at install. Flagged sensitive APIs (like `voice:listen`, `clipboard`, and `pet:speak:dynamic`) require explicit consent toggles.
- **SSRF & Private Host Guards**: Network fetch requests are limited to developer-declared hostnames and guarded against local SSRF.

### The SDK surface (`ctx`)
Plugins hook into the desktop environment via the `ctx` object, exposing:
- `ctx.pets` / `ctx.pet`: Manage default and spawned pet instances: spawn, move, animate, and react.
- `ctx.ui`: Alerts, transient/pinned bubbles, custom menus, panels, and status HUDs. Pinned mini HUD bubbles support compact 2x2 grid layouts with progress bars, such as Virtual Pet stats.
- `ctx.audio`: Trigger host-managed alert tones or user-imported custom audio.
- `ctx.schedule`: Set precise timer hooks (`once`, `every`, `daily`, `cron`, `at`).
- `ctx.ai` / `ctx.secrets`: Hook into the user's host-configured AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama) without exposing API keys to the plugin source.
- `ctx.storage`: Simple JSON key-value store with change subscriptions.
- Other APIs: `events`, `assets`, `bus`, `net` (with streaming support), `notify`, `voice` (TTS & push-to-talk STT), `auth` (PKCE browser flow), `files` (secure picked OS dialogs), `system`, `commands`, `status`, and `log`.

### Developer Tools & Commands

Create, validate, and test plugins using the official CLI.

#### 1. Scaffold a new plugin
Create a template from any of the official layouts (`blank`, `reminder`, `ambient`, `ai-chat`, `tamagotchi`, `calendar`):
```bash
npx @open-pets/cli plugin new "My Plugin" --template tamagotchi
```

#### 2. Validate
Verify manifest layout, permissions, and configuration schemas before packing:
```bash
npx @open-pets/cli plugin validate ./my-plugin
```

#### 3. Test harness
Write deterministic tests without launching the desktop app. Using `@open-pets/plugin-sdk/testing`'s `createTestHarness`, you can mock the host, advance clocks, trigger actions, and verify reactions:
```javascript
import { createTestHarness } from "@open-pets/plugin-sdk/testing";
import { register } from "./index.js";

const h = createTestHarness(register, { permissions: ["pet:speak", "schedule"] });
await h.start();
h.expectScheduled("decay");
await h.clock.advance("30m");
h.expectSpoke(/need attention/i);
```
Run plugin tests from your plugin project:
```bash
npm test
```

## Advanced: Agent Integrations

If you want your development agent to drive your desktop companion, OpenPets provides an optional local MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration layer.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/integrations.png" alt="OpenPets desktop integrations screen" width="100%" />
</p>

### How it works
When you configure an agent, OpenPets exposes standard MCP tools. The agent can trigger animations, change status, and display text bubbles locally:
1. **Claude Code**: Installs OpenPets MCP, memory instructions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
2. **OpenCode**: Installs OpenPets MCP, custom project instruction files, and the `@open-pets/opencode` automatic hook plugin.
3. **Cursor / Other MCP Clients**: Register OpenPets as a standard stdio or TCP MCP server.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/claude.png" alt="Claude Code integration with OpenPets" width="100%" />
</p>

### Diagnose your setup
Check whether the Claude hook and project Cursor MCP integrations are installed, need an update, or are broken, and whether the desktop app is reachable:
```bash
npx @open-pets/cli doctor
```
Pass `--cwd <path>` to inspect a different project's `.cursor/mcp.json`, or `--json` for machine-readable output. The command exits non-zero only when an integration is broken, so it is safe to run before reporting a bug.

### MCP Server Configuration
To run OpenPets as an MCP tool, add the server to your agent's configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openpets": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@open-pets/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
*Tip: To target a specific pet, pass the `--pet <petId>` argument.*

### Available MCP Tools
- `openpets_status`: Retrieve target pet ID and check runtime connectivity.
- `openpets_react`: Set pet reaction animations (e.g., `thinking`, `editing`, `testing`, `success`, `error`).
- `openpets_say`: Display a short speech bubble.
- `openpets_show_media`: Show an intentional local PNG, JPG, WEBP, or GIF in the pet bubble.

### Local Privacy & Safety
- All automated reactions run on static local triggers (e.g., when a command runs or a file is written).
- Speech content is validated to prevent leaking sensitive variables, paths, secrets, or multiline code snippets.
- Real-time interaction requires a local discovery token write/read, protecting the IPC bridge from external network triggers.

## Safety and Privacy

- **Local-Only**: OpenPets IPC works using a local socket/named pipe, secured with a per-run random security token.
- **SSRF Safety**: Plugin network connections are restricted to approved domains and blocked from local network/private IP access.
- **Dynamic Content Sanitization**: Any dynamic AI-speech text runs through strict local filters to redact paths, URLs, secrets, or multiline code snippets.
- **Sensitive Permission Consent**: Features accessing clipboard, microphone, or dynamic AI responses are off by default and require explicit user opt-in.
