# apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/

## Responsibility

React/Tailwind source for the Control Center management UI. This renderer presents dashboard status, pet management, coding-agent integrations, plugin management, and settings using narrow preload APIs backed by `windows.ts` IPC handlers and desktop services.

## Design

- **Route Shell**: In-renderer route state supports `dashboard`, `pets`, `integrations`, `plugins`, and `settings`; tray actions retarget the singleton window through route-change events.
- **Dashboard**: Reads a narrowed dashboard snapshot for default pet preview, install/catalog counts, plugin health, update status, and activity totals.
- **Pets**: Combines installed pets, catalog v3 pages/search, Codex imports, filters, detail panes, set-default/install/import/remove actions, and animated sprite previews.
- **Integrations**: Card-first setup UI for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, and Pi guidance, including Codex's guided one-window hook review and automatic trust polling, command mode/path controls, and preview/action flows.
- **Plugins**: Gallery-first plugin hub for installed/catalog/local/broken filters, catalog refresh, local load, install/update/uninstall, enable/disable, config modal, command execution, runtime/status display, and broken-state feedback.
- **Settings**: Startup, launch-at-login, optional speech-bubble narration, pet scale, reaction-animation mapping, update check, default-pet position reset, and pet reaction previews. The Voice subpage below LAN configures System Voice/PocketTTS/OpenAI-compatible/ElevenLabs, secure-key status, health/discovery/tests, per-pet overrides and fallbacks, push-to-talk, Codex conversation health, and the explicit wake-word packaging gate.
- **Bridge Contract**: All data and actions go through `window.openPetsControlCenter`; page snapshots intentionally omit raw install paths and unrelated app state.
