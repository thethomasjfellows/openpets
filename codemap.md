# Repository Atlas: OpenPets 2.0 Workspace

## Project Responsibility

OpenPets is a pnpm/TypeScript monorepo for an Electron desktop companion app with voice-first conversations, opt-in Vision awareness, and npm packages that let coding agents control animated desktop pets. The workspace provides a local IPC protocol, MCP server, CLI tooling, and editor-specific integrations for Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and Pi.

## System Entry Points

- `package.json`: workspace scripts for building, checking, testing, desktop packaging, and npm release orchestration.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: workspace membership for `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`: Electron main-process bootstrap for the desktop pet app.
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`: command-line setup, pet management, MCP launch, and plugin scaffold/validation entry point.
- `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`: MCP server entry point used by agents.
- `packages/client/src/index.ts`: public IPC client API consumed by integrations and tools.
- `packages/cursor/src/index.ts`: Cursor MCP/rules setup API.
- `packages/pi/src/extension.ts`: Pi coding-agent extension runtime entry point.
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`: public SDK v3 type contract for plugin authors.
- `plugins/official/`: first-party SDK v3 plugin product source consumed by desktop dev mode and plugin packaging/catalog release workflows.
- `scripts/sync-plugins.mjs`: tracked plugin catalog producer; enforces desktop-manifest parity, safe source/output paths and reviewed community tree digests, creates deterministic strictly validated ZIPs, and materializes ignored web release artifacts.

## Architecture Flow

1. The desktop app starts `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, initializes app, Companion, Vision, plugin, and voice services, creates tray/task windows, and starts a local IPC server.
2. Agent integrations (`packages/claude`, `packages/codex`, `packages/opencode`, `packages/cursor`, `packages/pi`, and `packages/mcp`) configure agents or emit pet commands through `@open-pets/client`.
3. The client discovers Unix sockets, Windows named pipes, or TCP endpoints for WSL cross-platform access.
4. The desktop IPC server routes commands through lease-managed controllers so default and agent pets can coexist safely.
5. The plugin service loads approved catalog or local `openpets.plugin.json` manifests, persists plugin state/config, schedules declarative timers, and bridges SDK v3 calls through permission-checked host modules for UI, audio, events, storage, AI, OAuth, voice, panels, and pet control.
6. Pet windows render reaction-driven animations, localized speech, host-rendered bubbles/alerts/HUDs, and status reactions using desktop state plus reaction mapping metadata.
7. Pet assets are resolved from built-in assets, locally developed Codex pets, or remotely downloaded catalog ZIPs.
8. Workspace packages share TypeScript/ESM build conventions and are wired together through pnpm `workspace:*` dependencies.

## Working Notes

- For repository-level orientation, start here, then open the specific folder codemap before editing.
- Contract validation files named `check-*.ts` are intentionally excluded from detailed codemap coverage except where they define package contract boundaries.
- Build artifacts, dependencies, tests, documentation, and binary assets are excluded from codemap state.
- `web/` is intentionally excluded from this codemap run; plugin source coverage is under `plugins/` only.
